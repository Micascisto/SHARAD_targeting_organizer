# SHARAD Targeting Organizer
A set of ArcGIS (and python scripts, in the future) to organize and optimize SHARAD targeting requests.

## SHARAD_targeting_organizer.tbx
This is step 1. This toolbox processes the "predict" shapefile selecting only targets of interest and adding relevant fields to a single output shapefile.

## Usage
Simply load the "predict" shapefile provided by SHOPS into ArcMap. Ignore the georeferencing warnings. Run the targeting organizer toolbox. Load the output "predict_all" shapefile
